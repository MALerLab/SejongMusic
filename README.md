## Jeonggan-bo
Jeongganbo was created by the King sejong in the 15th century and has been used to notate Korean court music ever since. We have constructed a dataset of 85 pieces by applying optical musical recognition (OMR) to all compositions available within the manuscripts published by the National Gugak Center. You can check the original image of Jeonggan-bo [here](https://www.gugak.go.kr/site/program/board/basicboard/list?boardtypeid=12&menuid=001003002002)
